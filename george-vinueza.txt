        the file you're working on and use git add . to stage the changes. Use commit -m "comment_here" to save the changes and then 
        git push to push the changes into the remote server. The first time you push to a new branch you must use git push -u origin branch_name
        and then you can just use git push. You can use git status to check to see if there are any differences with files and last
        commit. On github.com there will the option to create a new pull request which you must do before merging into master branch. 
        Make sure you select your forked repo and not main when you open a pull request. The merge must be reviewed by someone else.
